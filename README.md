# SalesPrediction-ModelPrediction-ExploratoryDataAnalysis

Predictive Analytics Project with EDA, Singular Value Decomposition, Multiple Linear Regression, and Lasso Regression
Welcome to the SalesPrediction-ModelPrediction-ExploratoryDataAnalysis repository! This project is a comprehensive exploration of predictive analytics, spanning two main parts. <br></br>In Part 1, we delve into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large dataset also employing the powerful data reduction technique called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In Part 2, we shift our focus to predicting sales using Multiple Linear Regression, conducting thorough data preprocessing, assessing model accuracy, and concluding with Lasso Regression on known covariates.

## Part 1:
Exploratory Data Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
In this initial phase, we conduct a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis on a sizable dataset. Our EDA involves visualizations, statistical summaries, and exploratory analyses to unravel underlying patterns and insights. Additionally, we implement the Singular Value Decomposition technique, a data reducing method, to handle large-scale data and reduce dimensionality while preserving key information.

### Key Highlights:
Comprehensive EDA techniques applied to gain insights into the dataset. <br>
Utilization of Singular Value Decomposition for effective data reduction. </br>

## Part 2: 
Multiple Linear Regression and Lasso Regression
Part 2 of the project focuses on predicting sales using the Multiple Linear Regression model. We meticulously preprocess the data to prepare it for regression modeling, assess the accuracy of our predictive model, and conduct additional exploratory data analysis specific to the regression task. Finally, we employ Lasso Regression to further refine our model by considering known covariates of coefficients.

### Key Highlights:
Implementation of Multiple Linear Regression for sales prediction. <br>
Thorough data preprocessing to enhance model performance.</br>
Evaluation of model accuracy and additional EDA for regression insights.<br>
Application of Lasso Regression for refining coefficient estimates.</br>
